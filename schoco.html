<p style="text-align:center"> "Oh hey! You picked my favorite candy! I recommend putting it in the freezer and eating it nice and cold. Or put it in a smore, I love peanut-butter and chocolate smores. When I was a younger, this was always my to go to candy to pick and got as much as I could of Reese’s when I was a kiddo. I think the most I've gotten of Reese’s chocolates was 74, and that's because I was that evil kid who got more than two from those unsupervised candy buckets that say 'take one'. Haha, but hey if they're going to be lazy, then I'm going to be greedy. Two sins cancel each other out right? I hope so."
