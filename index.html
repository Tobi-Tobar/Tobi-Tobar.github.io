<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Howdy!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to my Web Portfolio! My name is Bianka Del Carmen Tobar, but my preferred name is Tobi (He/Him/They/Them). I was born and partially raised in California and spent four years of my childhood in Guatemala. I’ve been in the Arts ever since I was a kid; We known that every kid doodle with crayons, but I was that kid who made stories. I created characters and expressed myself fully using my brand-new talent. Said talent has also put me in trouble for doodling in class, but I couldn’t help it. That passion has come and guided me through the years to chase after my dream. Not only to make Art my job, but to immerse myself with it. I went to Creative Connections Arts Academy, but I sadly didn’t take advantage of their art course hence I wanted to try other branches of art such as Music and Theater. Even though I was spitting Shakespeare, singing my lungs off, or Jazzing out with my Saxophone, I still drew and created in my own time. Once I entered American River College, that’s where I began my true passion. Originally, I wanted to become a 2D Animator. It’s the medium where you can make every wacky and unusual thing come to life. Though I wanted to be a jack of all trades, than a master of one. While taking General Education, I took as many art classes as I could, full steam ahead! Though throughout my many adventures at American River College, I’ve come to realize where I truly belong. The one field where I’ll be happy to spend the rest of my life in. I want to make Video Games. Not only the artistic aspects of it, but I want to learn the coding, the whole process of making a Game. Once I transferred to San Jose State University, while having an Art New Media and Art History Associates under my belt, the final stage of my adventure has begun. I’ve decided to apply into Digital Media Art to hone my knowledge around coding and creating art using technology. While taking Art 74 with James Morgan, he’s given me a very welcoming pathway into the world of Digital Media Art. I’ve never realized how many possibilities there are to making art with technology, it almost seems endless! I’ve learned so much from his class along with the ones I’m taking, and with this kind of knowledge, I can reach my own goals. I’m growing a new passion for sculpting in 3D environments and using coding as another art form. I technically dipped my feet into creating my first choose your own path game only using basic HTML. All my professors have inspired me into creating artwork I couldn't have imagined before. My end goal is to either create my own game or join a team to collaborate into making a game, whether it be the visuals side or the coding side, or both! Along with discovering and creating my own pieces of art using Digital Media Art Techniques and having them displayed around the world wide web.</p>
