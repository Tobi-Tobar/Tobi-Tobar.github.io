<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Howdy!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to my Webpage! Howdy! My name is Bianka Del Carmen Tobar, but my preferred name is Tobi (He/Him/They/Them). I’ve been
in the Arts ever since I was a kid. I mean yes every kid doodles with crayons, but I was that kid
who made stories, created characters, and expressed myself fully using my brand new talent.
Said talent has also put me in trouble for doodling in class, but I couldn’t help it. That passion
has come and guided me through the years to chase after my dream. Not only to make Art my
job, but to live with it. I went to Creative Connections Arts Academy, but I sadly didn’t take
advantage of their art course hence I wanted to try Music and Theater. Even though I was spitting
Shakespeare, singing my lungs off, or Jazzing out with my Saxophone, I still drew and created in
my own time. Once I entered American River College, that’s where I began my true passion.
Originally I wanted to become a 2D Animator. It’s the medium where you can make every
wacky and unusual thing come to life. While taking General Education, I took as many art
classes, full steam ahead! Though throughout my many adventures at American River College,
I’ve come to realize what I truly want to make. What I want to spend my time on for the rest of
my life. I want to make Video Games. Not only the artistic aspects of it, but I want to learn the
coding, the whole process of making a Game. Once I transferred to San Jose State University,
and having an Art New Media and Art History Associates under my belt, the final stage of my
adventure has begun. I’ve decided to apply into Digital Media Art to hone my knowledge around
coding and creating art using technology. While taking Art 74 with James Morgan, he’s given me
a very welcoming pathway into the world of Digital Media Art. I’ve never realized how many
possibilities there are to making art with technology, it almost seems endless! I’ve learned so
much from his class along with the ones I’m taking, and with this kind of knowledge, I can reach
my own goals. I’m growing a new passion for sculpting in 3D environments and using coding as
another art form. I technically dipped my feet into creating my first choose your own path game
only using basic HTML. I’m also currently taking Art 3 with Lance Fung and he has helped me
create art pieces that I couldn’t have made without his prompt and guidance. I’m hoping by the
end of the semester to display one of my art pieces I’ve made in a gallery. My end goal is to
either create my own game or join a team to collaborate into making a game, whether it be the
visuals side or the coding side or both. Along with discovering and creating my own pieces of art
using Digital Media Art Techniques and having them either displayed in galleries. </p>
