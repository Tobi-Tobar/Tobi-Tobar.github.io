<h1  style="text-align:center">You Picked Skeleton!</h1>

<img src="skeletonreal.jpg" alt="Skeleton" width="500" height="300">>

<p style="text-align:center">You picked to be a spooky skeleton! This equipment fills you with the power of Spaghetti, a heightened sense of hating a certain “He of Man” and dancing certain rattling tunes! However, this equipment is cursed! I recommend seeking a certain Tea of Obi to free yourself from the curse! 
<br>
<br>Equipment stats: +10 Amor, +7 Defense, +5 Attack
<br>
<br>Curse: The call of the grave – You feel as if you are being follow, but no one is ever there. Whispers of a forgotten friend echo through your mind, even sometimes a light brush of spoken air into your ear. You feel empty. 
<br>Now that you have your costume on, it's time to go out trick or treating! You scan the area and wonder which house to go first?
