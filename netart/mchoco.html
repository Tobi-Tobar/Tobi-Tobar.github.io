<p style="text-align:center">Tobi gives you your desired chocolate, and you couldn't wait to dig in. You unwrap it and give it a bite. You feel the first bite go through you. Literally. The piece pinballs down your ribs and onto the floor. Seconds later, you feel like yourself, like an actual human with just a skeleton costume and actually feel full again. 
<br>The curse is now lifted!
<br> You tried to give thanks, but you are back in front of your own house. You shrug it off and think where to go next.</p>
