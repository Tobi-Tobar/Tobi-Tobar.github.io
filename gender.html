<p >
I am the type of person who puts their pronouns in their bio on twitter. Actually I do it
over all of my social medias nowadays. I myself identify as a Demiboy; someone who
falls under the category of a masculine presenting Nonbinary person. I use the terms
He/Him/His or They/Them/Theirs. You'd think that in today's advanced society and
generations would respect that right? I've had it. There are too many people out there
who have ridiculed me for being this way, I've had people bluntly and purposely
misgender me, I've had people call my identity a mental disorder. What happened to
humanity? What happened to that human kindness? What happened to just showing a
little respect? I'm not someone to push and overly correct people, I've subtly said it
when I introduce myself or put it in my Zoom user, or wear a button large enough that
says my preferred pronouns. It shouldn't matter what I wear or how my voice sounds or
how long or short my hair is. It's a simple human right to live as someone they seem
themselves as, and to simply respect that. I had sadly lived a time with a very not
accepting family. I had to hide my button up polos, my ties, my jackets and cologne. I
had to play the "girl" in front of people because of their views. Whenever there was a
family gathering, I had to be effeminate and wear a proper dress, shave my legs, put on
make up, smell like the queen's rose garden. These were times that I myself wanted to
not even live due to all this. I suffered pretending to be something I wasn't, I suffered
having to fit in the perfect image of what a “woman” should be. I had to hide my first
relationship with a girl because there are people out there saying "God hates gays." This shouldn't be
political. This shouldn't even be religious. This is just a human basic right to just be
happy with how I feel about myself and how I view myself. This is my body, my mind,
and my single opinion. ***For your discretion, one photograph is titled Her Side , please
do not use She/Her/Hers for me, it’s for the sake of the idea of this project. Thank you.***
