<h1  style="text-align:center">Candy Received!</h1>


<p style="text-align:center">You pick your desired candy and show it to the camera so that she knows you respect her rules. She says thank you for coming, that you're the first kid who doesn't complain about the types of candy she's giving and really appreciates you coming <br> You absolutely made her day. <br> You decide to wonder down the street and collect more candy from the nearby neighbors. Your bag is getting quite heavy, but you haven't gone to the other side yet. <br> Where shall you go next?</p>
