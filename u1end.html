<p style="text-align:center"> You wonder back home with your heafty bag. Wether you went to a lot of house or not, you can't believe your treat bag is so heavy, it feels like it's about to burst. You dump the contents and to your suprise, it's all reeses peanut butter cups! You were sure you got a variety or your own preferred candy, but the only unique candies are the single candies you got from Goth Boi's house and Old Lady Betty's House. You start counting, each and every single cup. You got 75. <br> You beat Tobi's record, but maybe you gained a new curse as well. </p>
